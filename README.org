#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2020, ft. Haskell
#+Author: Nicholas Miklaucic

This is where I'm putting my AoC 2020 solutions. I'm trying to level up my
functional programming and abstract math skills, so I'll be using Haskell for
all of the problems.

*Caveat to anyone looking at the solutions:*

I am a Haskell programmer in the same way [[https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_Riviera][Dr. Nick from The Simpsons]] is a
doctorâ€”in the most generous possible sense of the term. (Perhaps by the end
I'll be better!) I'm sure there's plenty of non-idiomatic code here or more
elegant alternative solutions.
